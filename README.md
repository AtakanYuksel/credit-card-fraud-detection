# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Shallow Learning Methods<br>

I have an extremely imbalanced dataset that contains 30 feature and 1 label column. 28 of 30 features are results of PCA for privacy reasons. These are labeled from 'V1' to 'V28'. Unprocessed columns are 'Time' and 'Amount'.<br>
This is a work in progress project.<br>
You can recreate the results using 'environment.yml' with anaconda<br>

## Left to do:
<ol>
<li> Further EDA </li>
<li> Hyperparameter optimization </li>
<li> Final Conclusions </li>
</ol>

<br>

## Done:
<ol>
<li> Feature Selection </li>
<li> Feature Engineering (Undersampling, Oversampling) </li>
<li> Modeling (XGBoost, DecisionTree, SGDClassifier) </li>
<li> Classification Metrics </li>
</ol>
